# Mobile browser extension for Keepass and wallets
We should have a full-featured browser like [Kiwi](github.com/kiwibrowser/src) and a password manager to work in it via API.  Next step is integrating a reliable private web3 wallet and some https proxies or Tor.

Maybe a good first step would be to get [Kiwi](github.com/kiwibrowser/src) to [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/about/).

* https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.marmaro.krt.ffupdater seems awesome!
  *  -> Mull and Mulch seem highly interesting
    * https://divestos.org/fdroid/official/ worked IIRC 
  *  We could inspect https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/bitwarden-password-manager -> https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/tree/3b857345bbdb2f9a5bab070db2e328594f9fa830/apps/browser to find out the way to develop an addon for native Firefox on Android( and forks)
